## Features delivered

* New version of Android. Fixes for older devices that are unable to complete http requests. These older android devices, by default, do not send their requests with the required Transport Layer Security protocol version and Diary is discarding their requests.

This is a known bug with the Android operating system that was resolved in Android 5.0 (Lollipop), so it only effected Scouts on Kitkat.  Only 3% of our Android scouts, so easily less than 1% of total scouts were effected by this issue.
