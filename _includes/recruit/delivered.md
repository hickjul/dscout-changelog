### Features Delivered

* New version of Android with fixes for older devices that are unable to complete HTTP requests. These older Android devices, by default, do not send their requests with the required Transport Layer Security protocol version, therefore Diary is discarding their requests.

This is a known bug with the Android OS that was resolved in Android 5.0 (Lollipop), so it only affected Scouts on KitKat--less than 1% of total scouts.
